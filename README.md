# Ootztloo

  Ootztloo is an Agglutinative Experimental Engineered Constructed Language by me, Bach Davis. It is my first ConLang. The purposes of this ConLang were because I was bored, and to experiment with a language where every morpheme has exactly one grammatical meaning, at most.
  
  It has 136 characters, which I have separated into three fonts: Print, Cursive, and Phonetic. It has 80 tenses, including the Imperative and Infinitive tenses. It’s numerical system is a Balanced Nonary Positional System. Each word is usually about 1 or 2 lines long, making it extremely inefficient, because there is a roughly one-to-one ratio of words used in Ootztloo vs in English. It has 16 grammatical Parts of Speech, but 22 semantic Parts of Speech. Ootztloo’s vocabulary is on an as-needed basis.

  Feel free to suggest new <a src="https://github.com/staetyk/Ootztloo/discussions">words</a> and example sentences!
